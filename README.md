Parents Against Humanity
========================
A card set for horrible parents.

This is an expansion (perhaps with more cards, a stand-alone version) of 
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).  Use it to drink
and play cards with your friends while still implicitly talking about how
special your darling bundle is.

## Using this Set

[Download the PDF](https://github.com/gthole/parents-against-humanity/blob/master/parents-against-humanity.pdf?raw=true) and follow the instructions in the [original CAH set](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_MainGame.pdf).

## Generating cards

Want to add or modify some cards?  There's a short shell script to help!  Just
remember to commit the resulting PDF to the repo.

```bash
$ sh generate.sh
```

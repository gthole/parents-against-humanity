Parents Against Humanity
========================
A card set for horrible parents.

This is an expansion (perhaps with more cards, a stand-alone version) of 
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).  Use it to drink
and play cards with your friends while still implicitly talking about how
special your darling bundle is.

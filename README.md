Parents Against Humanity
========================
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/gthole/parents-against-humanity/blob/master/icon.png?raw=true" />
A card set for horrible parents.

This is an expansion (perhaps with more cards, a stand-alone version) of 
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).  Use it to drink
and play cards with your friends while still implicitly talking about how
special your darling bundle is.

- **Why won't you sleep?**
  - A diaper change two hours overdue
  - Thumbs, omnomnom
  - A toy up the nose
- **That's not going to wash out**
  - A poopsplosion
  - The soft spot in the skull
  - The 2.3 seconds between "my tummy hurts" and vomit in your bed


## Using this Set
